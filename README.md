# recruitment-mobile-exercise

You can choose between 3 exercises:
1. iTunes Store Lookup App
2. Movies App
3. Video Games App (for the brave ones)

## 1) Music App

Create an app that lets you do simple searches using [Apple's iTunes Store API](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/Searching.html).

For example to obtain all the entries of the musics corresponding to U2:

https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=U2&media=music

You will have between *one and two weeks* to complete this exercise. But please consider that *we will judge the result differently* based on the time taken to complete it. Especially on the quality of code and UI's details.

## 2) Movies App

Create a simple application using the [TVmaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api).


You will have between *one and two weeks* to complete this exercise. But please consider that *we will judge the result differently* based on the time taken to complete it. Especially on the quality of code and UI's details.

## 3) Video Games App (for the brave ones)

Create a video game library application that allows users to list their video games. And for a manager to manage these video game (create, edit, see list of others, etc.).

For the backend, be creative. You can either create it or use an existing one, if you find any (you can use kDrive api to save files for example)

As this exercise is harder, you will have between *two weeks and one month* to complete it. But please consider that *we will judge the result differently* based on the time taken to complete it. Especially on the quality of code and UI's details.


## Information

You are free in the choice of library and display but you must return a project coded in Swift for iOS or Kotlin for Android. You are also free regarding the display of data, the layout and navigation in the app.
